# Introduction to C/C++ history & Data types in C++ 

## **1. Introduction**
The journey from **assembly language** to modern high-level languages like **C** and **C++** marked a revolutionary shift in programming. This evolution enabled developers to write more complex, readable, and portable code, contributing to the rapid growth of software development. This document explores the key milestones that transformed low-level programming into a more accessible and efficient process.

---

### **1.1 Assembly Language: The Beginning**
- **Overview:**  
  - Introduced in the 1940s and 1950s as a **low-level language** closely tied to machine instructions.  
  - Programs were written with **mnemonics** (e.g., `MOV`, `ADD`) that correspond directly to CPU instructions.  
  - Highly efficient but difficult to write, maintain, and debug.

- **Key Features:**  
  - Direct hardware manipulation.
  - No abstractionâ€”every operation had to be explicitly coded.  
  - Platform-specific: programs written for one architecture could not run on another without modifications.

- **Challenges with Assembly:**  
  - Steep learning curve and complex syntax.  
  - Writing large-scale programs was time-consuming and prone to errors.

---

### **1.2 The Rise of C: A Paradigm Shift (1972)**
- **Overview:**  
  - **C** was developed by **Dennis Ritchie** at Bell Labs as a high-level alternative to assembly, originally to rewrite the **UNIX** operating system.  
  - It introduced **structured programming** with loops, conditionals, and functions, making code more modular and readable.  

- **Key Features:**  
  - **Portability:** Programs could be compiled for different hardware platforms with minimal changes.  
  - **Low-level access:** Provided access to memory through pointers, giving developers control similar to assembly.  
  - **Standard Library:** A collection of reusable functions to handle input/output, memory management, and more.  

- **Impact:**  
  - C became the language of choice for **operating systems, embedded systems**, and high-performance applications.
  - It laid the foundation for many modern languages, including **Python, Java, and JavaScript**.

---

### **1.3 The Birth of C++: Object-Oriented Programming (1985)**
- **Overview:**  
  - **C++** was created by **Bjarne Stroustrup** as an extension of C to support **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts.  
  - It combined the power of C with new paradigms like **encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.**

- **Key Features:**  
  - **Classes and Objects:** Encapsulate data and functions together, making it easier to model real-world systems.  
  - **Code Reusability:** Enabled through **inheritance** and the use of templates.  
  - **Operator Overloading:** Developers can redefine the behavior of operators for custom types.  

- **Use Cases:**  
  - Game development, large-scale software (like Adobe Photoshop), and real-time systems.  
  - C++ is still heavily used in performance-critical applications such as **game engines** and **financial systems**.

---

### **1.4 Why C and C++ Remain Relevant Today**
- **C**  
  - Used in system-level programming, embedded systems, and the development of operating systems like **Linux**.  
  - Known for its **efficiency** and **close-to-hardware control**.

- **C++**  
  - Powers major applications in **banking, games,** and **machine learning frameworks** like TensorFlow.  
  - Continues to evolve with new standards (e.g., **C++11, C++17, C++20**) that introduce modern features.

| Use Cases             | Embedded Systems, Drivers | OS Development, Firmware| Game Engines, Finance      |

-----------------------
## **2. Problem Solving in C++**
  ### **2.1 Why Use C++ for Problem Solving?**
  C++ offers the **speed of low-level programming** with the convenience of high-level features. It is one of the most widely used languages in **competitive programming**, known for its **efficiency, STL**, and **flexibility**.

  ### **2.2 Key Aspects of Problem Solving in C++**
  1. **Time and Space Efficiency**  
     - C++ is designed for **performance**, making it ideal for solving time-sensitive problems.  
     - Fine control over memory with **dynamic allocation** (via `new` and `delete`).

  2. **STL for Rapid Prototyping**  
     - Use STL containers such as **vectors** and **maps** to quickly model data.  
     - Algorithms like `std::sort()` or `std::binary_search()` provide efficient solutions with minimal code.
   
   

 ### **2.3 Steps to Solve Problems Systematically**
1. **Understand the Problem Statement**  
2. **Read Carefully:** Understand the inputs, outputs, and constraints.  
3. **Clarify Questions:** If anything is ambiguous, think through edge cases or re-read the prompt.  
4. **Identify Key Information:** Extract important details like input size, limits, or required operations.  
5. **Write Down a Rough Outline or Pseudocode:** Visualize the steps clearly before implementing the code.

### **2.4 Optimizing Solutions: Efficient Memory and Computing**

After understanding the problem and drafting a basic solution, the next step is to **find the most optimal solution** by focusing on two key aspects:  
1. **Efficient Memory Usage** (using the right data structures)  
2. **Efficient Computation** (using optimal algorithms)

-----------------
# **Hello World**
![hello](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4e5aecd-ddba-4a1b-9a61-af0f0a372e1c)
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    cout << "Hello World!" << endl ;

    return 0 ;
}
```


## **3.C++ libraries, Data types and operators** 

   ### **3.1 `iostream` Library and Namespace** 
The `iostream` library in C++ is essential for input and output operations. It provides functionalities to read from standard input (keyboard) and write to standard output (screen). The primary objects defined in this library are `cin`, `cout`, `cerr`, and `clog`.

#### Key Components

- **`cin`**: Standard input stream, used to take input from the user.
- **`cout`**: Standard output stream, used to display output to the user.
- **`cerr`**: Standard error stream, used to display error messages. It does not buffer output, meaning it displays output immediately.
- **`clog`**: Standard logging stream, used for logging messages. It is buffered and can be used for diagnostic messages.
  
### **3.2 `using namespace std;`**
C++ uses namespaces to organize code and avoid name conflicts. The std namespace contains all the standard library functions and objects, including those in the iostream library.
When you include the line:

`using namespace std;`
You tell the compiler that you want to use everything in the std namespace. This allows you to use standard library functions and objects without the std:: prefix.



   ## **4. Variables and Data Types in C++**

In C++, variables and data types are fundamental concepts that allow you to store and manipulate data. This section covers **variable naming rules**, **constants**, **identifiers**, and the different data types available, including special focus on **char, boolean,** and **ASCII codes**.

---

  ### **4.1 Variables Naming and Identifiers**
  - **Variables** are used to store data, and each variable must have a **name (identifier)**.
  - **Rules for Naming Variables:**
    1. The name must begin with a **letter** (A-Z or a-z) or an **underscore** (_).
    2. It can contain **letters, digits, or underscores** but no spaces.
    3. **Keywords** (like `int`, `return`) cannot be used as variable names.
    4. Variable names are **case-sensitive** (`MyVar` and `myvar` are different).
    
- **Example:**
  ```cpp
  int myAge = 25;   // Valid
  float _height = 5.9;  // Valid
  int 2cool = 10;   // Invalid: Cannot start with a digit
  ```

  ### **4.2 Constants in C++**
Constants are variables whose values **cannot be changed** once initialized.

Declared using the **`const` keyword** or the **`#define` directive**.

#### **Example using `const`:**
```cpp
const float PI = 3.14159;  // Constant variable
```

#### **Example using `#define`:**
```cpp
#define MAX_SIZE 100  // Preprocessor constant
```
### **4.3 Data Types and Sizes in C++**

C++ supports multiple data types, which vary in size and purpose. Below are some of the most common ones:

| Type                    | Typical Bit Width  | Typical Range                                 |
|-------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| char                    | 1 byte             | -127 to 127 or 0 to 255                       |
| unsigned char           | 1 byte             | 0 to 255                                      |
| signed char             | 1 byte             | -127 to 127                                   |

| signed int              | 4 bytes            | -2147483648 to 2147483647                     |
| short int               | 2 bytes            | -32768 to 32767                               |
| unsigned short int      | 2 bytes            | 0 to 65,535                                   |
| signed short int        | 2 bytes            | -32768 to 32767                               |
| long int                | 4 bytes            | -2147483648 to 2147483647     |
| signed long int         | 8 bytes            | same as long int                              |
| unsigned long int       | 8 bytes            | 0 to 18446744073709551615                     |
| long long int           | 8 bytes            | -(2^63) to (2^63)-1                           |

#### Explanation:
- **`int`**: Used for integer values.  
- **`float`** and **`double`**: Used for decimal numbers, with `double` providing more precision.  
- **`char`**: Stores a single character.  
- **`bool`**: Stores `true`/`false` values.  
- **`unsigned int`**: Only stores non-negative integers.

  ### 4.4 Special Characters in C++

In C++, special characters can be represented using escape sequences. Below are some of the most common ones:

| **Character** | **Escape Sequence** | **Description**                       |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Newline       | `\n`                | Moves the cursor to the next line    |
| Tab           | `\t`                | Inserts a horizontal tab              |
| Carriage Return| `\r`               | Moves the cursor to the beginning of the line |
| Backspace     | `\b`                | Moves the cursor back one space       |
| Single Quote  | `\'`                | Represents a single quote character    |
| Double Quote  | `\"`                | Represents a double quote character    |

### 4.6 Operators in C++
#### Arithmetic Operators

In C++, arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations. The common arithmetic operators are:

| **Operator** | **Description**           | **Example**            |
|--------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| `+`          | Addition                  | `a + b`                |
| `-`          | Subtraction               | `a - b`                |
| `*`          | Multiplication            | `a * b`                |
| `/`          | Division                  | `a / b`                |
| `%`          | Modulus (Remainder)      | `a % b`                |



#### Compound Assignment Operators

In C++, compound assignment operators combine an arithmetic operation with an assignment. These operators modify the value of a variable by performing a specific operation with another value. Below are the common compound assignment operators:

| **Operator** | **Description**                 | **Example**            |
|--------------|---------------------------------|------------------------|
| `++`         | Increment                       | `++a` or `a++`        |
| `--`         | Decrement                       | `--a` or `a--`        |
| `+=`         | Addition assignment             | `a += b`              |
| `-=`         | Subtraction assignment          | `a -= b`              |
| `*=`         | Multiplication assignment       | `a *= b`              |
| `/=`         | Division assignment             | `a /= b`              |
| `%=`         | Modulus assignment              | `a %= b`              |

#### Post increment and pre increment

In C++, the increment operator (`++`) can be used in two ways: **post-increment** and **pre-increment**. These operators are used to increase the value of a variable by 1, but they differ in the timing of the increment.

##### Post-Increment (`a++`)

In post-increment, the value of the variable is returned before it is incremented.

###### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    cout << "Initial value: " << a << endl;  // Output: 5
    cout << "Post-increment: " << a++ << endl;  // Output: 5 (returns original value)
    cout << "Value after post-increment: " << a << endl;  // Output: 6
    return 0;
}
```
##### Pre-Increment (`++a`)

In pre-increment, the value of the variable is incremented before it is returned.

###### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    cout << "Initial value: " << a << endl;  // Output: 5
    cout << "Pre-increment: " << ++a << endl;  // Output: 6 (returns incremented value)
    cout << "Value after pre-increment: " << a << endl;  // Output: 6
    return 0;
}

```



#### Comparison Operators
In C++, comparison operators are used to compare two values
| **Operator** | **Description**                          | **Example**            |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `==`         | Equal to                                 | `a == b`               |
| `!=`         | Not equal to                             | `a != b`               |
| `>`          | Greater than                             | `a > b`                |
| `<`          | Less than                                | `a < b`                |
| `>=`         | Greater than or equal to                 | `a >= b`               |
| `<=`         | Less than or equal to                    | `a <= b`               |

#### Logical Operators in C++

Logical operators in C++ are used to combine or invert boolean expressions. They return a boolean result (`true` or `false`). The common logical operators are:

| **Operator** | **Description**            | **Example**            |
|--------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| `&&`         | Logical AND                | `a && b`               |
| `\|\|`         | Logical OR                 | `a \|\| b`               |
| `!`          | Logical NOT                | `!a`                   |

#### ASCII Code

The ASCII code is a number that represents a charachter in computer:

##### Example of ASCII Values

Here are a few examples of ASCII values:

| **Character** | **ASCII Value** |
|---------------|------------------|
| `A`           | 65               |
| `a`           | 97               |
| `0`           | 48               |


##### Using ASCII in C++

In C++, you can use ASCII values to manipulate characters. Below is an example of how to print ASCII values of characters and convert characters to their corresponding ASCII values.

##### Example Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    char ch;

    cout << "Enter a character: ";
    cin >> ch;

    // Print the ASCII value of the character
    cout << "The ASCII value of '" << ch << "' is " << static_cast<int>(ch) << endl;

    // Print ASCII values for a range of characters
    cout << "ASCII values from A to Z:" << endl;
    for (char c = 'A'; c <= 'Z'; ++c) {
        cout << c << ": " << static_cast<int>(c) << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
## **5. Input and Output in C++**
### **5.1 `cin` & `cout`

In C++, input and output operations are primarily handled using the `cin` and `cout` objects, which are part of the `<iostream>` header.
The `cout` object is used to output data to the standard output (usually the console). The insertion operator (`<<`) is used to send data to `cout`.
The `cin` object is used to read data from the standard input (usually the keyboard). The extraction operator (`>>`) is used to get data from `cin`.

 ### **5.2 More in I/O in c++**
 #### Fixed Notation

By default, floating-point numbers may be displayed in scientific notation if they are very large or very small. Using `std::fixed` forces the output to be in fixed-point notation, which displays the number as a standard decimal number.

##### Setting Fixed Precision

To set a fixed precision for floating-point numbers, you can follow these steps:

1. Include the `<iostream>` and `<iomanip>` headers.
2. Use `std::fixed` to set the output format to fixed-point notation.
3. Use `std::setprecision(n)` to specify the number of decimal places.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip> // Required for std::setprecision
using namespace std;

int main() {
    double pi = 3.141592653589793;
    double e = 2.718281828459045;

    // Default output
    cout << "Default precision:" << endl;
    cout << "Pi: " << pi << endl; // Output may vary (scientific notation)
    cout << "e: " << e << endl;   // Output may vary (scientific notation)

    // Setting fixed precision
    cout << fixed; // Set to fixed-point notation
    cout << setprecision(4); // Set precision to 4 decimal places

    cout << "\nFixed precision:" << endl;
    cout << "Pi: " << pi << endl; // Output: 3.1416
    cout << "e: " << e << endl;   // Output: 2.7183

    return 0;
}
```

## ** 6.Errors**
**6.1 Syntax Errors**

These are also referred to as compilation Error ,These errors have occurred when the rule of C++ writing techniques or syntax has been broken. These types of errors are typically flagged by the compiler prior to compilation.


**6.2 Runtime Errors**

This type of error occurs while the program is running. Because this is not a compilation error, the compilation will be completed successfully.

**6.3 Logical Errors**

Even if the syntax and other factors are correct, we may not get the desired results due to logical issues. These are referred to as logical errors.
